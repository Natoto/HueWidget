## Setup

1. Grab a copy of the project
2. Change the value of the `HUE_API_USER` at the top of Hue Widget/TodayViewController.m to a username that works for your Hue hub (I won't go through how to do that, you can read the [Philips Hue API Getting Started guide](http://developers.meethue.com/gettingstarted.html). If you've followed that before exactly, the default value should work.)
3. Run the project (active scheme: 'Widgets', Simulator or Device it should work either way)
4. Swipe down to get Notification Center, swipe over to Today view
5. Tap 'Edit'
6. Enable 'Hue Widget'
7. Tap 'Done'
